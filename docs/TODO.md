# Todo

- [x] Make original Iosevka font for this website
    - Made an issue to the custom build temprate repo, and when it's accepted, I will make a PR that allow the user to leave the build to the relase or another branch so the build could be distributed like CDN, very easily. Until then, I will use font source's CDN.

- [x] Post page/Legal page
    - [x] Footnotes for writing articles: done by Astro's markdown built-in
    - [x] Why the theme setting on the code block affect and make it monochrome: The dual theme is expected in that case, and it just doesn't fit and override with something. I don't need to think about the detail.
    - [x] How does the CSS controlling work?: Shiki for codeblock is from Astro-side, and Tailwind Prose is controlling the rest. Shiki somehow has precedence.
    - [x] The font related variables from Shiki is defined by what?: Seemingly from theme, and I don't think i need to know
    - [x] Use the same font color for the post/legal page: overwridden the prose by tailwind
    - [x] How big the font size are in prose default?: It's 16px, so same as the text-base
    - [x] How can I make the font size for codeblocks bigger?: It's done by Tailwind prose control, since the default prose was applied, I learnd about the combination of <pre> and <code>
