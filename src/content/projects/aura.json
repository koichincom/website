  "description": "Intent-based Brain-Computer Interface system enabling high-level robotic control through EEG signalsâ€”users select objects and destinations while the system handles low-level manipulation autonomously.",
  "achievements": [
    "Led cross-university team (De Anza, UWaterloo, UCSD) in developing intent-based BCI architecture that reduces cognitive load vs traditional axis-by-axis control",
    "Implemented dual BCI paradigms: P300 speller (82.8% accuracy LOSO) for object selection and Motor Imagery (F1 ~0.61) for grasp/release commands",
    "Integrated computer vision (ArUco markers + planar homography), inverse kinematics, and real-time multiprocessing pipeline (125Hz EEG sampling)"
