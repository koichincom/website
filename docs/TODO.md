# Todo

- [x] Make original Iosevka font for this website
    - Made an issue to the custom build temprate repo, and when it's accepted, I will make a PR that allow the user to leave the build to the relase or another branch so the build could be distributed like CDN, very easily. Until then, I will use font source's CDN.
