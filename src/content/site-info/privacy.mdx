When you visit this website (the "Site"), the Site's infrastructure provider <NewWindow href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</NewWindow> processes basic request data to deliver and secure the Site (such as IP address, request headers, requested URL, and security-related metadata). Cloudflare notes this metadata often includes IP addresses and is processed for a limited period (see Cloudflare's <NewWindow href="https://www.cloudflare.com/trust-hub/gdpr/">GDPR / data processing overview</NewWindow>). The Site uses <NewWindow href="https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/">Cloudflare Web Analytics</NewWindow> to understand overall traffic and performance of the Site. Cloudflare states its Web Analytics does not use cookies or localStorage and does not fingerprint individuals for the purpose of displaying analytics. Web Analytics is designed to collect minimal performance/timing metrics via a beacon. The Site uses this information to:

1. Serve the Site
2. Maintain security and prevent abuse
3. Understand aggregate traffic and performance

The Site shares data with service providers only as needed (primarily Cloudflare) for content delivery, security, and analytics. The Site does not run behavioral advertising and does not track visitors across third-party websites over time. Browser "Do Not Track" signals are not used to change behavior on this Site (it still processes basic request/security data required to operate the Site). For cookie details, see the Site's [Cookie Policy](/cookie).
