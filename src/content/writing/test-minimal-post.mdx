This is the most minimal test post possible, containing only the required fields: title and published date. No optional fields like tags, pinned status, updates, or lastUpdated are included here.

## Purpose of Minimal Testing

Testing with minimal configurations helps ensure that the system gracefully handles cases where optional fields are absent. This is important because:

1. Not all content needs categorization
2. Some posts are one-off thoughts that won't be updated
3. Tags might not be relevant for every piece of writing
4. The UI should look good even without extra metadata

## What Should Still Work

Even without the optional fields, this post should:

- Display correctly in listings
- Render its content properly
- Show the publication date
- Work with the site's navigation and routing

This ensures backward compatibility and flexibility for content creators who prefer a simpler approach to writing.

## Code Examples

Here are some code examples to test syntax highlighting:

### JavaScript

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

### Python

```python
def calculate_sum(numbers):
    return sum(numbers)

result = calculate_sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(f"Sum: {result}")
```

### CSS

```css
.container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    padding: 1rem;
}
```

### Shell

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Running tests..."
npm run check
echo "Tests complete!"
```
