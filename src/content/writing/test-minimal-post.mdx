This is the most minimal test post possible, containing only the required fields: title and published date. No optional fields like tags, pinned status, updates, or lastUpdated are included here.

## Purpose of Minimal Testing

Testing with minimal configurations helps ensure that the system gracefully handles cases where optional fields are absent. This is important because:

1. Not all content needs categorization
2. Some posts are one-off thoughts that won't be updated
3. Tags might not be relevant for every piece of writing
4. The UI should look good even without extra metadata

## What Should Still Work

Even without the optional fields, this post should:
- Display correctly in listings
- Render its content properly
- Show the publication date
- Work with the site's navigation and routing

This ensures backward compatibility and flexibility for content creators who prefer a simpler approach to writing.
