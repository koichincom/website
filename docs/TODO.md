# Todo

- [x] Make original Iosevka font for this website
    - Made an issue to the custom build temprate repo, and when it's accepted, I will make a PR that allow the user to leave the build to the relase or another branch so the build could be distributed like CDN, very easily. Until then, I will use font source's CDN.
- [x] RSS and Atom feed integration
    - https://gsong.dev/articles/astro-feed-unified/
    - https://jenxi.com/atom-feed-for-astro
- [x] Two site maps are generated
- [x] List clicked article's divider hidden problem
- [x] Font flash prevention and learning about font loading display settings (swap, optional, etc)
- [ ] Content structure and display refactoring: What to display on the home, writing, and project pages
- [ ] Dynamic header href link changing
- [ ] Design decisions, where to put what
- [ ] Add Japanese language support

## Some of other ideas

- Reading progress bar at the top
- Reference feature for writing articles
- View count for articles in the lists (dynamic rendering + database?)
