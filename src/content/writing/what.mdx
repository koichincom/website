This is another fake post, written to add variety to the writing feed. It is short and practical, meant to test how brief sections feel.

## What shipped
- A landing page cleanup pass.
- A few utility classes for spacing.
- A refreshed hero image.

## What is next
I want to tighten the copy, add a couple of new photos, and make sure the navigation has a little more rhythm. Nothing big, just steady, careful motion.
