This test post demonstrates the updates tracking feature. Content evolves, and
keeping a history of update dates helps readers judge freshness and context.

The latest update date should be derived from the most recent entry in
`updates` (March 1, 2025 for this post), while the full list preserves the
change history.

Use this post to confirm that lists, feeds, and detail pages display the correct
"last updated" value computed from `updates`.
