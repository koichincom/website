Start with a cliche, life is short. It is a common saying, but what does that really mean? It means the importance of prioritization in life. Minimalism is also a common word nowadays. It is often associated with decluttering physical possessions, but true minimalism goes beyond that. The true minimalism in our lives is to reduce the unnecessary notion that yields our attention and cognition, and focus on what truly matters. For example, thinking about deleting social media accounts itself is not the act of true minimalism. It is a hobbish act of minimize something. If you don't access the social media that often, it is not likely an act of true minimalism. In other words, true minimalism is a prioritization, but also taking a balance, because the time is limited. Minimalism is the way of refining our lives. And, the purpose and the means should not be confused. If you do the "minimalism" as a hobby, as a goal, it is fine, but you should recognize it is art, and it is the same as collecting stamps.

Think about some examples of true minimalism. For example, if you are a software engineer, you may want to focus on learning new technologies, improving your coding skills, and building meaningful projects. You may want to minimize the time spent on social media, watching TV, or playing video games. By doing so, you can prioritize your time and energy on what truly matters to you. True minimalism is not about depriving yourself of things you enjoy, but rather about being intentional with your time and energy. It is about focusing on what truly matters to you and letting go of the rest. By doing so, you can live a more fulfilling and meaningful life. True minimalism is a mindset that can be applied to all aspects of life, including work, relationships, and personal growth. It is about being intentional with your time and energy, and focusing on what truly matters to you. By embracing true minimalism, you can live a more fulfilling and meaningful life. True minimalism is focusing on the time of cognition. If the thing is not related to you, then you don't need to try to minimize it. It is a waste of time. The time is limited, and you should focus on what truly matters to you.
