## What's processed when you visit

When you visit this website, our infrastructure provider [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) processes basic request data to deliver and secure the site (such as IP address, request headers, requested URL, and security-related metadata). Cloudflare notes this metadata often includes IP addresses and is processed for a limited period (see Cloudflare's [GDPR / data processing overview](https://www.cloudflare.com/trust-hub/gdpr/)).

## Analytics

We use [Cloudflare Web Analytics](https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/) to understand overall traffic and site performance. Cloudflare states its Web Analytics does not use cookies or localStorage and does not fingerprint individuals for the purpose of displaying analytics. Web Analytics is designed to collect minimal performance/timing metrics via a beacon.

## How we use information

We use this information to:

1. Serve the website
2. Maintain security and prevent abuse
3. Understand aggregate traffic and performance

## Sharing

We share data with service providers only as needed to run the site (primarily Cloudflare) for content delivery, security, and analytics.

## Do Not Track

This site does not run behavioral advertising and does not track you across third-party websites over time. Browser "Do Not Track" signals are not used to change behavior on this site (we still process basic request/security data required to operate the site).

For cookie details, see our [Cookie Policy](/cookie/). Cloudflare's cookie reference is here: [Cloudflare cookies](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/reference/policies-compliances/cloudflare-cookies/).
