1. You were born to be free. Take others’ advice with a grain of salt. Every action should ultimately connect to your happiness, and its process can bring pleasure to others.
2. There is no inherent meaning in everyone’s life. Everything you care about can feel meaningless. So, it's better to do what we find and define as meaningful. (≈ Active Nihilism)
3. Don’t dwell on the past, nor cling to the future, but live in the moment. Reflecting on the past doesn’t shape our futures but wastes our time. (≈ mindfulness)
4. Simplicity is everything. Once we grasp the intrinsic nature, the world is quite simple. (≈ minimalism)
5. “Divide each difficulty into as many parts as is feasible and necessary to resolve it.” — René Descartes (≈ divide and conquer)
6. We only need direction. We shouldn't label ourselves.
7. Avoid chasing perfection. Perfection leads only to wasted time. Make things work.
