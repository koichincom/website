# Website

My personal website and blog, designed to be fast, simple, and accessible.

To achieve this, I built it with:

- **Astro** as the core framework
- **View Transitions API** for smooth page transitions
- **Vim-style keyboard navigation** for power users
- **Auto dark mode** for comfortable reading
