The goal of this post is simple: verify how short paragraphs and small lists feel in the layout. It is intentionally plain, a lightweight sketch you can replace later.

## A small ritual
I like mornings that start slowly. A few quiet minutes make the rest of the day feel more intentional. The checklist below is not strict. It is a reminder that gentle structure can still create momentum.

### Checklist
- Open a window and let the room breathe.
- Write three quick thoughts before checking any screens.
- Make something warm and hold the cup for a moment.
- Stretch for two songs.

## Closing note
If the page looks balanced after this section, the typography is doing its job. The content is filler, but the spacing should still feel calm.
